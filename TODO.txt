HIGH
- setTimeout / Interval not working, to implement this we would need to 
    implement an entire event loop.
- Closure tests should read script src and import automatically. Also load 
  the html contents
- Support callbacks/delegates with some trickery
  
MED
- Fork the JavaScript.Net project as it appears to have died.

LOW
- Node interface
