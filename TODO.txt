
- More unit testing frameworks
- Fork the JavaScript.Net project as it appears to have died.
- Find a way of getting more fail information from tests (exceptions).
- Node interface
- Improve the auto publish js to also update the git downloads.  
  - ILMerge all managed assemblies (and exe)

- jish    
  - jish.assembly command is pretty much useless as it needs to inject 
  javascript back into the engine and this is not allowed.  Currently a hack
  is in place to return a dodget IDictionary<string, IInlineCommand> which 
  needs to be replaced with an IL generated wrapper.
  - Separate jish and js.net, jish is probably now the project with most potential
  - Installer? Including making it the default js interpreter?
  - Generic classes not supported
  - Generic methods not supported in .create (both static and instance)  
    * It would be nice to change the signature of generic methods so we 
    could do something like (in JavaScript):      
      // Where 'NameSpace.ClassName' is the generic argument
      variable.GenMethod('NameSpace.ClassName', arg0, arg1);
