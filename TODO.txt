HIGH
- Support callbacks/delegates with some trickery
   * - Rename method to <methodname>_internal
   * - <methodname>_internal should replace the delegate param with a strin 
   *   (id of real method in jish.internal scope)
   * - Generate JS method with original name/namespace
   *     - Generate <newid>
   *     - Save the callback in the jish.internal['<newid>']   
   *     - Call and <methodname>_internal, with a string arg (<newid>)
   * - Create mock Action / Func
   * - Execute original method (C#) with mock action
   * - When mock Action / Func gets called call original callback in JS
- Support multiple callbacks/delegates params
