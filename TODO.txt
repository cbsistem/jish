
- More unit testing frameworks
- Fork the JavaScript.Net project as it appears to have died.
- Find a way of getting more fail information from tests (exceptions).
- Node interface
- Improve the auto publish js to also update the git downloads.  
  - ILMerge all managed assemblies (and exe)

- jish
  - Generic classes not supported
  - Generic methods not supported in .create (both static and instance)  
    * It would be nice to change the signature of generic methods so we 
    could do something like (in JavaScript):
      
      // Where 'NameSpace.ClassName' is the generic argument
      variable.GenMethod('NameSpace.ClassName', arg0, arg1);  
  - Commands should be initialised on each call
  - Add unit testing for command arg validation
