- More unit testing frameworks
- Fork the JavaScript.Net project as it appears to have died. Can we make it c#?
- Find a way of getting more fail information from tests.
- Blogs or Wikis for each framewor that will enable promotion better
- Use linked assemblies instead of internal embedded referrence for deployment
- Node interface
- Better place for the Trace listener initialisation

- Web Site

- jish
  - Alow importing static methods with overrides, and generics?
  - Update readme, especially with hacks, i.e. Jish commands are executed at top 
  regardless of position in files, clear, help not supported, etc
  - Move as much code as possible to JavaScript (jish.js)
  - Commands should analyse input and parse into required argument types
